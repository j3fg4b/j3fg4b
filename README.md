👋 Hi, I'm @j3fg4b, and I'm a researcher passionate about investigating the intricate dynamics of macrophages and how they evolve in the context of aging and HIV infections.

👀 My primary research interest revolves around gaining a deeper understanding of how macrophages, a critical component of the immune system, undergo changes as individuals age and when they are affected by HIV infections. Macrophages play a pivotal role in host defense and tissue homeostasis, and uncovering the nuances of their behavior in these contexts holds significant potential for improving healthcare outcomes.

🌱 Currently, I am dedicated to expanding my skill set in the fields of single-cell RNA sequencing and the R programming language. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a powerful tool to explore the diversity of macrophage populations and their gene expression profiles at a single-cell level. R, as a versatile statistical and data analysis language, enables me to effectively analyze and interpret the complex datasets generated from such experiments.

💞️ I'm actively seeking opportunities for collaboration with fellow researchers who share my interest in aging and innate immunity. Collaborative projects not only enhance the breadth of research but also foster a vibrant exchange of ideas and expertise. If you're involved in research related to aging or innate immunity and would like to explore collaborative projects or simply have a stimulating discussion, please don't hesitate to reach out.

📫 You can contact me at jbreiten@ucdavis.edu. Feel free to drop me an email to initiate a conversation or connect with me on platforms like GiftHub. I'm always open to engaging in meaningful discussions and collaborations within the research community. Let's work together to advance our understanding of macrophages, aging, and HIV infections for the betterment of healthcare and human well-being.
